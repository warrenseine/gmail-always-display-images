Gmail Always Display Images
===========================

Like me, you're bored with pointless security concerns that force
you clicking links you _will_ click anyway. So what not automate it?

This Google Chrome extension injects a script watching for open emails and will
automatically click on "Always display images from". That's a quick
and dirty hack based on the great [Gmail unofficial JS API](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail.js).
